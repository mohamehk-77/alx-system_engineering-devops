## Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Slowdown (February 14th, 2024)

**Issue Summary:**

* **Duration:**  2 hours, from 1:00 PM PST to 3:00 PM PST (February 14th, 2024)
* **Impact:** Our e-commerce platform experienced significant performance degradation. Users encountered slow page loading times and intermittent errors during checkout. An estimated 40% of users were affected during the outage period.
* **Root Cause:** Misconfiguration of the caching layer on the web server. 

**Timeline:**

* **12:50 PM PST:** Monitoring alerts triggered, indicating a spike in server response times and increased error rates.
* **1:00 PM PST:** Engineering team notified of the performance degradation. Initial investigation focused on the frontend servers and Content Delivery Network (CDN) configuration, suspecting a potential network issue causing latency.
* **1:30 PM PST:** Deeper analysis revealed no network issues. Database servers were investigated for potential bottlenecks, but no significant anomalies were found.
* **2:00 PM PST:**  Given the lack of conclusive evidence in frontend, CDN, and database layers, the incident was escalated to the backend infrastructure specialists.
* **2:15 PM PST:** Backend team identified a misconfigured caching layer on the web server. The configuration caused excessive cache invalidation, leading to a surge in database queries and overwhelming backend servers.
* **2:30 PM PST:** A temporary workaround was implemented, adjusting the caching configuration to utilize cached data more effectively. Page load times improved significantly.
* **3:00 PM PST:** Permanent configuration changes were rolled out, ensuring optimal caching behavior and preventing future issues.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured caching layer. The cache invalidation settings were too aggressive, causing the web server to bypass cached data for every user request. This resulted in a significant increase in database queries, overwhelming the backend servers and leading to slow performance. 

To resolve the issue, the backend team adjusted the caching configuration to strike a balance between data freshness and performance. The cache invalidation settings were optimized to retain relevant data for a longer duration while still ensuring updates are reflected after a reasonable timeframe. Additionally, cache warming mechanisms were implemented to pre-populate the cache with frequently accessed data during server restarts.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

* **Improve Caching Configuration Management:**  Conduct regular audits of caching configurations to ensure optimal performance. 
* **Automate Caching Monitoring:** Implement automated monitoring for cache hit rates and database queries to identify potential issues proactively.
* **Invest in Team Training:** Enhance team awareness of potential caching pitfalls and best practices for configuration management.
* **Review Alert Thresholds:** Evaluate and fine-tune monitoring alerts for web server performance to trigger notifications at appropriate levels to optimize troubleshooting efficiency.
* **Implement Automated Rollbacks:**  Explore the possibility of implementing automated rollback procedures for configuration changes, allowing for faster reversion if issues arise after deployments.

This incident highlights the importance of proper caching configuration for maintaining optimal website performance. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages in the future and ensure a smooth user experience for our customers.
